# Interview Scheduler
Interview scheduler is a Single Page Application to track students interviews. The app allows a user to book, edit or cancel interview appointments. It uses React and data is saved using an API server and an PostgreSQL Database. This project was created in a Test Driven Development environment for quality assurance.

## Project Features
- Appointment days (Monday to Friday) are displayed and colour-coordinated depending on availability
- The days show the number of slots available as a snapshot of the week
- A user can switch between days and see detailed information
- Booked and available slots are clearly differentiated
- A user can book interviews by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of          interviewers
- A user can change the details of an existing interview by pressing the edit icon
- A user can cancel an existing interview, a pop-up message will ask to confirm the action before permanently deleting an interview
- Days display currently remaining spots and capture updates after each modification
